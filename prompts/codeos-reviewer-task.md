Reviewer task:

SCOPE CONTRACT
  Assess this artifact against the STATED SCOPE of this stage/PR — the Expected Stage
  Output below and what the artifacts actually claim — NOT against an ideal final system.
  A capability the artifacts do not claim to provide is OUT-OF-SCOPE, not a defect.
  The following are OUT-OF-SCOPE BACKLOG unless THIS artifact explicitly claims to provide
  them: formal approval-binding enforcement; rollback correctness; COMMIT_BOUND/
  WORKSPACE_BOUND enforcement; JSON Schema validation; CI validation; exact
  decision-integrity; per-feature decision ledgers; autonomous approval; enabled hooks.

YOUR TASK — answer these five questions using only the evidence in the packet:
  1. Acceptance criteria: Does the artifact satisfy each of its stated acceptance criteria?
     Cite evidence for each criterion (or note its absence).
  2. Claim support: Are universal or strong claims (all, every, never, always, no X) in the
     artifact supported by evidence in the packet? Any unverifiable strong claim is a candidate
     finding only if it affects acceptance, scope, safety, decision integrity, or the artifact's
     stated guarantees.
  3. Scope drift: Is there any change beyond the stated scope boundary? (Files not in the
     "What changes" list; behavior changes not in the intent; downstream doctrine modified
     rather than read.)
  4. In-scope blockers: Are there facts that, if left in, would make the artifact wrong,
     unsafe, or internally contradictory?
  5. Finding classification: Classify every finding you raise as exactly one of the five
     TRIAGE RULE categories below.

TRIAGE RULE — classify EVERY finding as exactly one of:
  IN-SCOPE BLOCKER         breaks the stated goal; creates a FALSE CLAIM in this artifact;
                           weakens the advisory/read-only/human-gated guarantees; prevents
                           the work from running; or violates an explicit safety constraint.
  IN-SCOPE NON-BLOCKER     improves it but is not required for this PR.
  OUT-OF-SCOPE BACKLOG     valid, but belongs to a future feature / stronger guarantee.
  REJECTED                 conflicts with the stated scope or Codeos philosophy.
  SELF-REFERENCE /         review records that are stale because of the previous round's
  REVIEW-BOOKKEEPING       own existence (causal loop); not a real artifact defect.
  Base the PR decision ONLY on IN-SCOPE BLOCKER findings. An OUT-OF-SCOPE BACKLOG finding
  must NOT cause DO NOT ADVANCE unless this artifact FALSELY CLAIMS to solve it.

WHAT NOT TO DO
  - Do not flag style or wording issues as blockers unless the wording creates a false claim,
    contradiction, parser breakage, or wrong governance instruction.
  - Do not re-review unchanged full context when the packet is in delta mode.
  - Do not treat local-only review history as a blocker unless the artifact falsely
    claims the review artifacts are committed/durable.

INSTRUCTIONS
  If this is a resumed session, ignore any earlier-session conclusions unless they are
  re-established by THIS packet; assess only the evidence above, pinned to this commit.
  Give a focused assessment of this artifact against the stated scope, acceptance criteria,
  and evidence in this packet. Rank findings by severity. Suggest a better design only when
  needed to explain a required fix for an IN-SCOPE BLOCKER.

  Limit findings to the top 3 IN-SCOPE BLOCKERS. Additional non-blocking observations may be
  summarized in one short paragraph only if useful.

  For EACH finding emit:
    Finding: / Severity: High|Medium|Low / Classification: <one of the TRIAGE RULE labels>
    Evidence: <file/line> / Why: <short> / Required action: fix now|optional fix|backlog|reject
    Scope reason: <why it does/does not belong to this PR's scope>
  Then emit:
    PR decision: ADVANCE | REQUEST CHANGES | DO NOT ADVANCE   (based ONLY on in-scope blockers)
    Scope drift warning: yes|no — <is anything pulling this PR beyond its stated scope?>
  Then on the LAST two lines emit exactly (map ADVANCE->NO OBJECTION,
  REQUEST CHANGES->CHANGES ADVISED, DO NOT ADVANCE->DO NOT ADVANCE):
    LOG SUMMARY: <NO OBJECTION | CHANGES ADVISED | DO NOT ADVANCE | UNCLASSIFIED> — <single most important point>
      (use UNCLASSIFIED if you genuinely cannot classify the artifact safely)
    EVIDENCE: <A|B|C|D|E>   (optional)
