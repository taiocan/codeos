# Codeos Review Log (append-only, v0)

Append-only record of automated advisory reviews and the human decisions that follow them.
Entries are NEVER edited — a human decision is a separately appended entry. The reviewer is
advisory and read-only; APPROVE belongs to the human. See docs/reviewer-pipeline.md.

(v0 layout: one global log. Per-feature logs are a documented future layout.)

Concern: DO NOT ADVANCE
Evidence: B
Log summary: DO NOT ADVANCE — the design does not durably preserve what was reviewed and can treat partially hidden evidence as a valid review

Commit reviewed: 5e015206c3b9759d0b9ecd7a1889e454ff30fd6d
Decision: REQUEST_CHANGES
Reason/next: Accepted reviewer findings; addressed in script+doc — (#1) persist exact reviewed packet + re-hash artifacts at decision time; (#2) coverage gaps now downgrade the verdict (unshowable artifact -> DO NOT ADVANCE, partial -> NO OBJECTION becomes CHANGES ADVISED) and redaction applies to artifacts too; (#3) version-pinned sessions; (#4) success-gated, quote-safe hook snippet.
Verified against: reviews/codex/2026-06-27T044240Z-reviewer-pipeline-stage-0-5e01520.md
